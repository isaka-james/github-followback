# GitHub Followers Tracker ðŸš€
- [ ] Still On Development..[ 9 Feb, 2024 ]

So, you've been scrolling through your list of GitHub followers, thinking, "Wow, I wonder who's got my back?" But then, horror strikes! You realize that not everyone you follow is following you back. How dare they?

Fear not, brave GitHub warrior! Introducing the GitHub Followers Tracker! ðŸŽ‰

## Why This Existence?
I know, I know. You might be wondering, "Why on earth would someone create such a tool?" Well, let me tell you a little story.

Once upon a time, in the vast kingdom of GitHub, there lived a developer (let's call him Bob). Bob wanted to know who wasn't returning the favor of following him back. So, he set out on a quest to find a tool that could help him. Alas, all he found were official GitHub APIs with a little fructuation. (Yes, fructuation. It's a word. Look it up.)

Determined not to be defeated by fructuation, Bob decided to take matters into his own hands. He crafted his very own script to track down those elusive non-followers. And thus, the GitHub Followers Tracker was born!

## What's in Store?
Now, you might be thinking, "Okay, cool story bro, but what does this tracker actually do?"

Well, dear friend, let me enlighten you. This magnificent tool will soon bless you with the power to uncover the names of those who have forsaken you by not following you back. But wait, there's more! Bob is also working tirelessly on an unofficial API that will reveal the names of both your loyal followers and the souls you have chosen to follow.

## How to Contribute?
Are you as excited about this project as we are? Do you want to join Bob on his noble quest to conquer the realm of GitHub followers? Well then, saddle up your code steed and gallop over to our repository! Whether you're a seasoned developer or a fresh-faced newbie, there's a place for you in our merry band of contributors.

## Stay Tuned!
So, my fellow GitHub aficionados, keep your eyes peeled and your fingers poised on the keyboard. The GitHub Followers Tracker is coming soon to a repository near you. Until then, happy coding, and may your followers be ever faithful! ðŸŒŸ
